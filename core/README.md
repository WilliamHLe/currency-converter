The app is a currency calculator and its purpose is to convert between two different currencies when a button is clicked.


User stories:

*  As a user, I wish to choose which currency to convert from and to, so the conversion can be relevant for me when I have decided the currencies.
*  As a user, I want a button, so that when I have decided currencies and written in an amount, I can convert them.
*  As a user, I wish to see the calculation as an output, so I know what the calculation is.
*  As a user, I wish to save and load the conversion, so that I will save time and don't have to do the same calculation all over again.
*  As a user, I wish to see a field under the conversion that shows norwegian kroner corresponding to some other popular currencies, so I can check a specific currency very fast. 
*  As a user, I want a switch button, so I can switch the currencies, because it's faster then choosing both the currencies again separately.
*  As a user, I want a button that erases the fields, so that I can start all over.
*  As a user, I want a button that can change the currencies, so that they can be up-to-date.

This is a screenshot of how the calculator is suppose to look:
