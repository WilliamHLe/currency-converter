# **gr1921 project**

This is a group project for the course IT1901 Informatikk Prosjektarbeid I. We have decided to make a simple currency converter.
The goal of this course is to develop crucial skills in cooperation, project planning and source-code management. This includes learning
to use Git and using Git-repository manager GitLab.

## Requirements

You need to have a recent version of Java installed.

## Installation

1. Use any IDE thats supports Java and clone: 

```bash
https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/gr1921/gr1921.git
```

Or use Git to clone:

```bash
 $ git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/gr1921/gr1921.git
```

2. Create module from existing sources and select build.gradle file in the root folder.

3. Build and run project.

## Usage


The project consists of four modules; "core", "fxui", "restapi" and "restserver". \
"App.java" is the file to be runned and is located in fxui/src/main/java/valutaKalk/fxui \

You can find another README file inside the core module that describes the user history and a screenshot of the application.
